- **Range:** Self (15 foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M*
- **Duration:**  1 minute (concentration)
___
You let the censer sap your own life force to aid your allies and distract you foes. When you cast this spell and at the start of each of your subsequent turns, you take 3d6 *Radiant* damage that cannot be negated in any way. A thicker smoke starts emanating from the censer and fills a sphere of radius 15 feet centered around the censer. Unlike the thin smoke usually emitted, this does not linger and moves and fades instantaneously with the censer. While this spell is active, you cannot make attacks with your thurible.
___
At the start of their turn, allies within the smoke heal half the latest damage you have inflicted on yourself. They also have advantage on all saving throws against spells, poisons, diseased, and Charm effects while within the smoke. You do not gain these benefits.
___
Any enemies within this smoke have disadvantage on all attack rolls. At the start of their turn, any Undead take *Radiant* damage equal to the amount of damage you last inflicted on your self.
___
If this spell were to end for any reason, the effects persist till the start of your next turn, after which the thick smoke instantly vanishes.
