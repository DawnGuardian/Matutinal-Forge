#### A Concert of Concordance and Discordance
##### *Don't judge me on this. I made this for a campaign where my bladesinger was being bullied a bit and I finally got a boon.*

___
You concentrate a massive amount of arcane energy into yourself, transforming it into a vessel for music to inspire your allies and dishearten your enemies.

*Casting:*
The spell consumes one spell slot of each level upto the level of casting. It takes your entire turn to cast this and you cannot take any reactions, but for the duration of the turn you are wreathed in arcane energy, which gives you effect of the spell *Shield* and gain resistance damage from magical attacks. Till the end of the casting phase, you cannot willingly move from your place, and anyone ending their turn within 5 feet of you takes 1d10 *Arcane* damage. This spell cannot be dispelled, but can be counterspelled during the first turn of casting.

*Heroic Song:*
After you finish casting this spell, a musical score as if performed by an entire orchestra blooms outward from you, spreading arcane power upto 50 feet from you and is audible to 500 feet from you (henceforth, range refers to the range of the spell effect - the range at which the song can be heard remains unchanged). For the duration of this phase of the spell:

- Allies within range can add your Intelligence modifier to their saving throws. This can be done only by an ally once per their turn.
- Conscious allies within range regain 1d4 hit-points upto their maximum at the start of their turn.
- Enemies entering the spell's range for the first time must make a Wisdom saving throw or become *Enraptured*. *Enraptured* enemies cannot take any reactions for the duration of their turn. *Enraptured* enemies can attempt to snap out of it at the end of their turn.
- The entire duration of this turn becomes your blade song. Your base speed increases by 20 ft. instead of 10 ft. Due to transforming your entire body into a conduit for music, you can now use both hands to perform wepaon attacks.
- On your turn as a bonus action, you can pulse the spell to increase it's radius by 10 feet, upto a maximum total radius of 100 feet.

*Aftermath:*
- Physical Recoil: Forcing such quantites of arcane energy into yourself comes with some consequences. At the end of the *Heroic Song* phase, you take one point of *Exhaustion* and are stunned for a minute.
- Mental stress: The stress of concentrating on the spell, the musical composition, and on combat mentally exhauts you. All Wisdom and Intelligence saves you make are at disadvantage. Any Intelligence or Wisdom saves to be made by a target of your spells now have a DC of (8 + Intelligence modifier) instead of (8 + Proficiency + Intelligence modifier). Concentration checks on spells are now made at disadvantage. All these effects fade only after a long rest.
- Note: *Greater Restoration* will mitigate the physical recoil, but not the mental stress
___
**At higher levels:** Casting the spell at higher levels increase the initial arcane bloom (i.e., the range of the spell) to be (level of spell - 1) times 10. The maximum radius of the spell increases to (level of spell - 1) times 20.
