## Player Companions
An elf runs through the forest, chasing a band of bandits. As the chase enters a clearing, the bandits face the elf, confident of the power of their numbers till a great dire wolf burst forth and mauls the closest bandit, the battle was already over when the chase started.
___
A few hundred feet above the city, a giant eagle lazily floats in a pattern. No one can see her, and even if they could, they would not be able to see her rider, both on the lookout for their target.
___
The two mage hunters have their quarry at their feet, fully bound and gagged to prevent him from casting. They think the quiver and muffled sounds are from fear, only when they feel the prick of two fangs sink into them do they realise it was laughter, but by then that's their last thoughts.
___

### Choice of Companion
Companions must be beasts, of CR level 2 or lower.
___

### Suggestions on affecting Party Experience
The companion is part of the party, but it is not a fully fledged character. Experience is divided as if the companion represents half a character. For example, 4 full player characters a one companion would be representative of 4.5 characters.
___

### Level 1 Stats
Starting stats for the companion are based on the monster stat block given by the source book. The ability scores given are capped by certain restriction. The creature can have one score with a maximum of 16, and two other scores with a maximum of 14, and the rest are capped to 12. No score gets increased however. For example, a spread of `[18,16,15,14,12,8]` gets reduced to `[16,14,14,12,12,8]`.
___
The starting health of the companion is based of the hit die on the monster block. The minimum hit die is a d8, and the maximum hit die is a d10. The companion starts with the maximum roll of it's hit die + its Constitution modifier.
___
In additional, the companion has proficiencies in two saving throws. If the monster block has more than two, choose two from the existing, if the block has less than two, choose additional proficiencies using the highest ability scores. The companion can only have a total of 3 ability proficiencies, chosen using the same method as the saving throws. The companion has proficiency in light armour, but the light armour made for companions costs twice that of the base version due to the craftsmanship required.
___
Finally, the companion doesn't benefit from the Multiattack feature if it is present.

### Second Wind
Your companion has a limited well of stamina that it can draw on to protect itself from harm. On its turn, it can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + its level. Once it uses this feature, the companion must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
___

### Bonded Armour
Beginning at 2nd level, your companion's AC now includes your spellcasting modifier (or the Constitution modifier if the bonded character doesn't have one) if it is unarmoured or wearing Light Armour, and you are within 5 feet of it. This range increases to 15 at level 10.
___

### Ability Score Improvement

___

### Danger Sense
Your companion is getting more acclimated to dangerous situations. Beginning at 10th level, if there are any creatures nearby that are hostile to the companion or to their bonded character, treat the companion's passive Perception as if it has the feat *Alert* towards those threats. This feature does not work towards traps, including programmed automations, or spells.
___

### Inseparable
Beginning at 18th level, if you or your companion has to make Death Saving Throws, and are within 10 feet of each other, one can use its reaction to turn a fail into a success. This can only be done twice long rest. Turning a critical fail into a success uses both the 'charges'.
___
Medicine checks made to stabilise the other are made with advantage.
___

### Loyal Bonds
At 20th level, while you and your companion are within 30 feet of each other, you share the skills and saving throws you are proficient with, though you still use your own modifiers. Further, you are both immune to any controlling effects that puts the other in danger. (To clarify, Charm effects still work, but are immediately broken if the companion or the bonded character are put in direct danger because of it.)
