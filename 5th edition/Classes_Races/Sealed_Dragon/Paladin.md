* (a) five Javelins or (b) any Simple Melee Weapon
* an Explorer’s Pack, a Holy Symbol, and Chain Mail
___

### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *Hallow* Spell.
___
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
___

### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your level × 5.
___
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.
___
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
___
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
___

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
___
**Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
___
**Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
___
**Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
___
**Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
___

### Spellcasting
Your own powers might have been Sealed, but you've learnt to draw from other sources. And to put yourself in the service of a god is nothing new to you as a Dragon, only now, you have to rely on them for power. By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a Cleric does.
___

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
The table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
___
You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
___
For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *Cure Wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
___
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
___

##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
* **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
* **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
___

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.
___

##### Oath Spells
Refer the Sealed Dragon: Race section for information on Oath Spells. When you gain these spells at the indicated levels, they do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day, and are always prepared.
___

### Divine Smite
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.
___

### Divine Health
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.
___

### The Seals Start to Fracture
At 3rd level, the tiniest cracks have begun to form in your Seals.
___
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
___
**Conquering Presence:** You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
___
**Guided Strike:** You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.
___

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
___
Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
___

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
___

### Aura of Protection
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
___
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
___

### Breath Weapon
The Seals on you start breaking. At 7th level, you can finally access your fundamentum and exhale destruction that defines a Dragon. Once per short or long rest you exhale a breath aligned with your ancestry as shown in the Dragon racial table. The damage die is d6, the number of dice is half your level (rounded down), and the save DC is your spell save DC. On a successful save, targets take half damage.
___
At 9th level, this breath can also recharge on a 20 on a d20, at 14th level, it recharges on 18 or above on a d20, and at 19th level, it recharges on 15 or above on a d20.
___

### Claws
At 10th level, the Seals deteriorate further and you are now able to manifest your claws. They are considered Finesse weapons, and deal 2d6 damage on hit. They are not considered magical weapons for the sake of overcoming immunity or resistance.
___

### Aura of Courage
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.
___
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
___

### Improved Divine Smite
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
___

### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.
___
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
___

### Wings
The Seals deteriorate further and allow you to unfurl your wings again. At 15th level, once per long rest, you are able to manifest your wings as a bonus action. These wings last 5 hours or till you dismiss them as a bonus action. To do so, you must be wearing light armour, or no armour. If you don any other armour while your wings are present, you take 5d6 bludgeoning damage every 12 seconds. If you are reduced to 0 HP by this damage, you cannot use your wings to fly till they are healed by a Heal spell or a Regeneration spell.
___
With your wings, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.
___
At 18th level, your flying speed increases to 60 feet.
___

### Scales
At 18th level, your beautiful scales finally manifest. While not wearing any armour, your AC is 14 + Dexterity Modifier.
Further, you gain damage resistance to elemental damage aligned with your ancestry and from non-magical melee damage.
___

### The Seals Break: Strength of Devotion
Broken and destroyed, your seals are finally gone but you have not lost the experience and power you have gained as a mortal, adding to your already supreme true form. But despite this, there are lingering embers that burn from your seals and you cannot maintain your true form permanently ..... yet. Maybe one day, you will find the ability to permanently remove your seal.
___
At level 20, you can finally assume your true form. You shapeshift into an ancient Dragon equivalent of your draconic species as an action. You can’t use this ability again until you finish a long rest. You can stay in your Dragon form for 1d4 + 1 hours. You cannot extend or increase your time as your true form in any way.
___
While in your true form, the following limitations apply:
* When you transform, you assume half the Dragon’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your sealed form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your sealed form. For example, if you take 10 damage in your true form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage in your sealed form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your sealed form to 0 hit points, you are not knocked unconscious.
* Your breath weapon does 15d10 damage, instead of the damage indicated on the stat block.
* If possible, your equipment drops to the floor. Worn items that are not magical (mundane armour, clothes) are destroyed during the transformation process. Any magical items on you (including worn) drops safely.
* You emanate an aura of frightfulness in a 30-foot radius. The first time an enemy creature enters the aura, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become *Frightened* of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.
___
Your sealed form statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Dragon if they are higher (capped to 16) but you retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores, and your HP while in sealed form. You also retain all of your skills and saving throw proficiencies. In addition, you become proficient in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws if the Dragon is. If the Dragon has any legendary or lair actions, you cannot use them. You also do not gain legendary resistances.
___
