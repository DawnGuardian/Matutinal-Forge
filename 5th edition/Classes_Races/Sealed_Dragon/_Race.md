# Sealed Dragon Race

### Rejected Birthright
Born to be the most powerful race in the multiverse, Sealed Dragons are Wyrms that are trapped in mortal forms that may or may not forever hold them hostage. These Sealed Dragons are one of many, but the most common are the ones that were kidnapped during their Wyrmling period, where a Dragon is not yet of great power. It is rare for older Dragons to be sealed, but members of the Draconic Pantheon has been known to mete out punishments similar to this. This mortal state does little to permanently weaken a Dragon, because a Dragon's soul, like those of Fey and Giants, is likened to a god and will eventually grow stronger, slowly breaking out.
___

### Cursed Body
One does not become a Sealed Dragon and no Dragon in their right mind would ever wish to be trapped in an inferior mortal body. With an infinitely strong body and constantly growing power, Dragons are revered as mortal gods capable of shaking the very foundations of a world once they grow powerful enough. And unlike other creatures, this strength is assured. Sealed Dragons follow the same pattern but in quick bursts. While sealed, their power grows far more quicker than a normal Dragon but this has a limit, and most Sealed Dragons die quick. This is due to an inability to adapt. After all, Dragons never once adapted to anything, everything else adapts to them.

### Notes
* <u>**This is not a comprehensive list.**</u>
* ^1^ These Dragons have their damage resistance feature in Scales changed to all Slashing, Piercing, and Bludgeoning.
* ^2^ An Emerald Dragon breathes out a powerful gust of wind.
* ^3^ A Sapphire Dragon emits a cone of panic inducing sounds.
* ^4^ Use the same d8 as the Spell *Prismatic Spray*, and replace 8s with a simple re-roll.
* ^5^ A Howling Dragon emits a cone of maddening sounds.
* ^6^ Half damage die (rounded up) to Fire and half damage die (rounded down) to Necrotic.
* ^7^ 'Breath' does no damage. All those that fail the save are Charmed by the Dragon for the next minute and repeat the save if they take damage equal to or more than twice the Sealed Dragons level, or if Counter Charmed by a spell, ability, or action.
* ^8^ Use a d6 to determine type. First five are the same as the Prismatic Spray spell, and 6 is Radiant. This elemental affinity lasts 1d10 days before you can roll the next elemental affinity.

*Conjuration, Level 3*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 Minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M*
- **Duration:**  24 Hours
___
You conjure a two-story tower made of stone, wood, or similar suitably sturdy materials. The tower can be round or square in shape. Each level of the tower is 10 feet tall and has an area of up to 100 square feet. Access between levels consists of a simple ladder and hatch. Each level takes one of the following forms, chosen by you when you cast the spell:
___
* A bedroom with a bed, chairs, chest, and magical fireplace
* A study with desks, books, bookshelves, parchments, ink, and ink pens
* A dining space with a table, chairs, magical fireplace, containers, and cooking utensils
* A lounge with couches, armchairs, side tables and footstools
* A washroom with toilets, washtubs, a magical brazier, and sauna benches
* An observatory with a telescope and maps of the night sky
* An unfurnished, empty room
___
The interior of the tower is warm and dry, regardless of conditions outside. Any equipment or furnishings conjured with the tower dissipate into smoke if removed from it. At the end of the spell’s duration, all creatures and objects within the tower that were not created by the spell appear safely outside on the ground, and all traces of the tower and its furnishings disappear.
___
You can cast this spell again while it is active to maintain the tower’s existence for another 24 hours. You can create a permanent tower by casting this spell in the same location and with the same configuration every day for one year.

___
\* - (a fragment of stone, wood, or other building material)
___

#### Hallucinatory Terrain
*Illusion, Level 4*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 Minutes
- **Range:** 300 feet (150 foot cube)
- **Components:** V, S, M*
- **Duration:**  24 Hours
___
You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.
___
The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.
___
\* - (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)
___

#### Polymorph
*Transmutation, Level 4*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Duration:**  1 Hour (Concentration)
___
This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
___
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
___
The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
___
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
___
The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
___
\* - (a caterpillar cocoon)
___

#### Commune with Nature
*Divination, Level 5, Ritual*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
___
You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn't function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.
___
You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:
___
* terrain and bodies of water
* prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
* powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead
* influence from other planes of existence
* buildings
___
For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.
___

#### Steel Wind Strike
*Conjuration, Level 5*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
___
You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can see within range. Make a melee spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target takes 6d10 force damage.
___
You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.
___
\* - (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
___
