* (a) a Component Pouch or (b) an Arcane Focus
* an Explorer’s Pack
* two Daggers
___

### The Seals Start to Fracture
The tiniest cracks have begun to form in your Seals. As the leaking magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your true form to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. When you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.
___

### Spellcasting
Your own powers might have been Sealed, but you know where the cracks in your seals are, and you can slip you power through them. Not a lot, but just enough to cast the arcane spells.
___

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list. You learn additional Sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the table.
___

##### Spell Slots
The table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
___
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *Burning Hands* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *Burning Hands* using either slot.
___

##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.
___
The Spells Known column of the table shows when you learn more Sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
___
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
___

##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
* **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
* **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
___

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your spells.
___

### Font of Magic
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.
___

##### Sorcery points
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the sorcery points column of the table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.
___

##### Flexible Casting
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.
___

##### Creating Spell Slots
You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.
___
Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.
___
**Creating Spell Slots**
| Spell Slot Level  | Sorcery point Cost |
|:-----:|:---:|
|  1st  | 2 |
|  2nd  | 3 |
|  3rd  | 5 |
|  4th  | 6 |
|  5th  | 7 |
___

##### Converting a Spell Slot to sorcery points
As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot’s level.
___

### Metamagic
The world used to bend to you, now a measure of it is available to use. At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th, and one more at 17th.
___
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
___

##### Careful Spell
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.
___

##### Distant Spell
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.
___
When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.
___

##### Empowered Spell
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.
You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
___

##### Extended Spell
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
___

##### Heightened Spell
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.
___

##### Quickened Spell
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
___

##### Subtle Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.
___

##### Twinned Spell
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).
To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, Magic Missile and Scorching Ray aren’t eligible, but Ray of Frost and Chromatic Orb are.
___

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
___
Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
___

### Breath Weapon
The Seals on you start breaking. At 6th level, you can finally access your fundamentum and exhale destruction that defines a Dragon. Once per short or long rest you exhale a breath aligned with your ancestry as shown in the Dragon racial table. The damage die is d6, the number of dice is half your level (rounded down), and the save DC is your spell save DC. On a successful save, targets take half damage.
___
At 9th level, this breath can also recharge on a 20 on a d20, at 14th level, it recharges on 18 or above on a d20, and at 19th level, it recharges on 15 or above on a d20.
___

### Claws
At 10th level, the Seals deteriorate further and you are now able to manifest your claws. They are considered Finesse weapons, and deal 2d6 damage on hit. They are not considered magical weapons for the sake of overcoming immunity or resistance.
___

### Wings
The Seals deteriorate further and allow you to unfurl your wings again. At 14th level, once per long rest, you are able to manifest your wings as a bonus action. These wings last 5 hours or till you dismiss them as a bonus action. To do so, you must be wearing light armour, or no armour. If you don any other armour while your wings are present, you take 5d6 bludgeoning damage every 12 seconds. If you are reduced to 0 HP by this damage, you cannot use your wings to fly till they are healed by a Heal spell or a Regeneration spell.
___
With your wings, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.
___
At 18th level, your flying speed increases to 60 feet.
___

### Scales
At 18th level, your beautiful scales finally manifest. While not wearing any armour, your AC is 14 + Dexterity Modifier.
Further, you gain damage resistance to elemental damage aligned with your ancestry and from non-magical melee damage.
___

### The Seals Break: Might of a Dragon
Broken and destroyed, your seals are finally gone but you have not lost the experience and power you have gained, adding to your already supreme true form. But despite this, there are lingering embers that burn from your seals and you cannot maintain your true form permanently ..... yet. Maybe one day, you will find the ability to permanently remove your seal.
___
At level 20, you can finally assume your true form. You shapeshift into an ancient Dragon equivalent of your draconic species as an action. You can’t use this ability again until you finish a long rest. You can stay in your Dragon form for 1d4 + 1 hours. You cannot extend or increase your time as your true form in any way.
___
While in your true form, the following limitations apply:
* When you transform, you assume half the Dragon’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your sealed form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your sealed form. For example, if you take 10 damage in your true form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage in your sealed form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your sealed form to 0 hit points, you are not knocked unconscious.
* Your breath weapon does 15d10 damage, instead of the damage indicated on the stat block.
* If possible, your equipment drops to the floor. Worn items that are not magical (mundane armour, clothes) are destroyed during the transformation process. Any magical items on you (including worn) drops safely.
___
Your sealed form statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Dragon if they are higher (capped to 16) but you retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores, and your HP while in sealed form. You also retain all of your skills and saving throw proficiencies. In addition, you become proficient in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws if the Dragon is. If the Dragon has any legendary or lair actions, you cannot use them. You also do not gain legendary resistances.
___
Further, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.
