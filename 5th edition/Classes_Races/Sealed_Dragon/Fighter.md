You learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.

___

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
___
The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level.
___

### Breath Weapon
The Seals on you start breaking. At 7th level, you can finally access your fundamentum and exhale destruction that defines a Dragon. Once per short or long rest you exhale a breath aligned with your ancestry as shown in the Dragon racial table. The damage die is d6, the number of dice is half your level (rounded down), and the save DC is your spell save DC. On a successful save, targets take half damage.
___
At 9th level, this breath can also recharge on a 20 on a d20, at 14th level, it recharges on 18 or above on a d20, and at 19th level, it recharges on 15 or above on a d20.

Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
___
You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.
___

### Claws
At 10th level, the Seals deteriorate further and you are now able to manifest your claws. They are considered Finesse weapons, and deal 2d6 damage on hit. They are not considered magical weapons for the sake of overcoming immunity or resistance.
___

### Wings
The Seals deteriorate further and allow you to unfurl your wings again. At 15th level, once per long rest, you are able to manifest your wings as a bonus action. These wings last 5 hours or till you dismiss them as a bonus action. To do so, you must be wearing light armour, or no armour. If you don any other armour while your wings are present, you take 5d6 bludgeoning damage every 12 seconds. If you are reduced to 0 HP by this damage, you cannot use your wings to fly till they are healed by a Heal spell or a Regeneration spell.
___
With your wings, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.
___
At 18th level, your flying speed increases to 60 feet.
___

### Scales
At 18th level, your beautiful scales finally manifest. While not wearing any armour, your AC is 14 + Dexterity Modifier.
Further, you gain damage resistance to elemental damage aligned with your ancestry and from non-magical melee damage.
___

### The Seals Break: Martial Prowess
Broken and destroyed, your seals are finally gone but you have not lost the experience and power you have gained as a mortal, adding to your already supreme true form. But despite this, there are lingering embers that burn from your seals and you cannot maintain your true form permanently ..... yet. Maybe one day, you will find the ability to permanently remove your seal.
___
At level 20, you can finally assume your true form. You shapeshift into an ancient Dragon equivalent of your draconic species as an action. You can’t use this ability again until you finish a long rest. You can stay in your Dragon form for 1d4 + 1 hours. You cannot extend or increase your time as your true form in any way.
___
While in your true form, the following limitations apply:
* When you transform, you assume half the Dragon’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your sealed form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your sealed form. For example, if you take 10 damage in your true form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage in your sealed form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your sealed form to 0 hit points, you are not knocked unconscious.
* Your breath weapon does 15d10 damage, instead of the damage indicated on the stat block.
* If possible, your equipment drops to the floor. Worn items that are not magical (mundane armour, clothes) are destroyed during the transformation process. Any magical items on you (including worn) drops safely.
* The number of Extra Attacks you have is reduced to 1 (ie, you can make a total of 2 attacks when you take the Attack action)
___
Your sealed form statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Dragon if they are higher (capped to 16) but you retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores, and your HP while in sealed form. You also retain all of your skills and saving throw proficiencies. In addition, you become proficient in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws if the Dragon is. If the Dragon has any legendary or lair actions, you cannot use them. You also do not gain legendary resistances.
___
Further, due to your martial experience, you gain an additional Extra Attack (ie, when you take the Attack action, you can attack a total of 4 times).
___
