## Class Features
With this class of a Sealed Dragon, you gain the following class features.
___

### Hit Points
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level.
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per level after 1st
___

### Proficiencies
* **Armor:** Light Armour, Medium Armour, and Shields
* **Weapons:** Simple Weapons
* **Tools:** Thieves' Tools, Tinker's Tools, one type of Artisan's Tools of your choice
* **Saving Throws:** Constitution, Intelligence
* **Skills:** Choose any two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception and Sleight of Hand
___

### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* any two Simple Weapons
* a Light Crossbow and 20 Bolts
* (a) Studded Leather Armour, or (b) Scale Mail
* Thieves' Tools and a Dungeoneer's Pack
___

### Magical Tinkering
At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have tinker’s tools or other artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:
* The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
* Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
* The object continuously emits your choice of an odour or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
* A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.
* The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.
___
You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.
___

### Spellcasting
You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.
___

##### Tools Required
You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the Player’s Handbook for descriptions of these tools.
___
After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.
___

##### Cantrips (0-Level Spells)
At 1st level, you know two Cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional Artificer Cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the class table.
___
When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Artificer Cantrips you know with another Cantrip from the Artificer spell list.
___

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
___
You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are 5th-level, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *Cure Wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
___
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
___

##### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
* **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
* **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
___

##### Ritual Casting
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
___

### Infuse Item
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.
___

##### Infusions Known
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer Infusions” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.
___

##### Infusing an Item
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “Attunement” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).
___
Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.
___
You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.
___

### The Seals Start to Fracture
At 3rd level, the tiniest cracks have begun to form in your Seals.
You gain proficiency with Alchemist’s Supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.
___
You also always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.
| Level | Spell |
|:-----:|:------|
| 3rd  | *Healing Word, Ray if Sickness* |
| 5th  | *Flaming Sphere, Melf's Acid Arrow* |
| 9th  | *Gaseous Form, Mass Healing Word* |
| 13th | *Blight, Death Ward* |
| 17th | *Cloudkill, Raise Dead* |
___
And finally, whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table below for the elixir’s effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.
___
Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist’s supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.
___
When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir’s effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.
___
You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir’s effect from the Experimental Elixir table.
| d6 | Effect |
|:---:|:-----|
| 1 | **Healing:** The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier |
| 2 | **Swiftness:** The drinker’s walking speed increases by 10 feet for 1 hour |
| 3 | **Resilience:** The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes |
| 4 | **Boldness:** The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute |
| 5 | **Flight:** The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes |
| 6 | **Transformation:** The drinker’s body is transformed as if by the *Alter Self* spell. The drinker determines the transformation caused by the spell, the effects of which last for 10 minutes.|
___

### The Right Tool for the Job
At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with tinker’s tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan’s tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.
___

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
___
Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
___

### Alchemical Savant
At 5th level, you develop masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your Alchemist’s Supplies as the spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals Acid, Fire, Necrotic, or Poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
___

### Breath Weapon
The Seals on you start breaking. At 6th level, you can finally access your fundamentum and exhale destruction that defines a Dragon. Once per short or long rest you exhale a breath aligned with your ancestry as shown in the Dragon racial table. The damage die is d6, the number of dice is half your level (rounded down), and the save DC is your spell save DC. On a successful save, targets take half damage.
___
At 9th level, this breath can also recharge on a 20 on a d20, at 14th level, it recharges on 18 or above on a d20, and at 19th level, it recharges on 15 or above on a d20.
___

### Tool Expertise
Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.
___

### Flash of Genius
Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.
___
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
___

### Arcane Jolt
At 9th level, you learn new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the strike to create one of the following effects:
* The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
* Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.
___
You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
___

### Claws
At 10th level, the Seals deteriorate further and you are now able to manifest your claws. They are considered Finesse weapons, and deal 2d6 damage on hit. They are not considered magical weapons for the sake of overcoming immunity or resistance.
___

### Magical Item Adept
When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:
___
You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.
___

### Spell Storing Item
At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn’t have it prepared).
___
While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.
___

### Wings
The Seals deteriorate further and allow you to unfurl your wings again. At 14th level, once per long rest, you are able to manifest your wings as a bonus action. These wings last 5 hours or till you dismiss them as a bonus action. To do so, you must be wearing light armour, or no armour. If you don any other armour while your wings are present, you take 5d6 bludgeoning damage every 12 seconds. If you are reduced to 0 HP by this damage, you cannot use your wings to fly till they are healed by a Heal spell or a Regeneration spell.
___
With your wings, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.
___
At 18th level, your flying speed increases to 60 feet.
___

### Magical Item Savant
At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:
* You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
* You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.
___

### Chemical Mastery
By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:
___
You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.
You can cast greater restoration and heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use alchemist’s supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.
___

### Scales
At 18th level, your beautiful scales finally manifest. While not wearing any armour, your AC is 14 + Dexterity Modifier.
Further, you gain damage resistance to elemental damage aligned with your ancestry and from non-magical melee damage.
___

### Magical Item Master
Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once.
___

### The Seals Break:  Argonnessen's Artificer
Broken and destroyed, your seals are finally gone but you have not lost the experience and power you have gained, adding to your already supreme true form. But despite this, there are lingering embers that burn from your seals and you cannot maintain your true form permanently ..... yet. Maybe one day, you will find the ability to permanently remove your seal.
___
At level 20, you can finally assume your true form. You shapeshift into an ancient Dragon equivalent of your draconic species as an action. You can’t use this ability again until you finish a long rest. You can stay in your Dragon form for 1d4 + 1 hours. You cannot extend or increase your time as your true form in any way.
___
While in your true form, the following limitations apply:
* When you transform, you assume half the Dragon’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your sealed form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your sealed form. For example, if you take 10 damage in your true form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage in your sealed form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your sealed form to 0 hit points, you are not knocked unconscious.
* Your breath weapon does 15d10 damage, instead of the damage indicated on the stat block.
* If possible, your equipment drops to the floor. Worn items that are not magical (mundane armour, clothes) are destroyed during the transformation process. Any magical items on you (including worn) drops safely.
___
Your sealed form statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Dragon if they are higher (capped to 16) but you retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores, and your HP while in sealed form. You also retain all of your skills and saving throw proficiencies. In addition, you become proficient in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws if the Dragon is. If the Dragon has any legendary or lair actions, you cannot use them. You also do not gain legendary resistances.
___
Further, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:
* You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
* If you’re reduced to 0 hit points while in your Sealed form but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.
___
