When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

___

### Spellcasting
Your own powers might have been Sealed, but you've learnt to draw from other sources. By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the ranger spell list.
___

##### Spell Slots
The table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
___
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *Animal Friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *Animal Friendship* using either slot.
___

##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Ranger spell list.
___
The Spells Known column of the table shows when you learn more Ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
___
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
___

##### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
* **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
* **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
___

### Primeval Awareness
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.
___

### The Seals Start to Fracture
At 3rd level, the tiniest cracks have begun to form in your Seals.
___
Your tenacity fueled by your knowledge and magical might can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.
___

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
___
Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
___

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
___

### Breath Weapon
The Seals on you start breaking. At 7th level, you can finally access your fundamentum and exhale destruction that defines a Dragon. Once per short or long rest you exhale a breath aligned with your ancestry as shown in the Dragon racial table. The damage die is d6, the number of dice is half your level (rounded down), and the save DC is your spell save DC. On a successful save, targets take half damage.
___
At 9th level, this breath can also recharge on a 20 on a d20, at 14th level, it recharges on 18 or above on a d20, and at 19th level, it recharges on 15 or above on a d20.
___

### Land’s Stride
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
___
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.
___

### Hide in Plain Sight
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.
___
Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
___

### Claws
At 10th level, the Seals deteriorate further and you are now able to manifest your claws. They are considered Finesse weapons, and deal 2d6 damage on hit. They are not considered magical weapons for the sake of overcoming immunity or resistance.
___

### Vanish
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
___

### Wings
The Seals deteriorate further and allow you to unfurl your wings again. At 15th level, once per long rest, you are able to manifest your wings as a bonus action. These wings last 5 hours or till you dismiss them as a bonus action. To do so, you must be wearing light armour, or no armour. If you don any other armour while your wings are present, you take 5d6 bludgeoning damage every 12 seconds. If you are reduced to 0 HP by this damage, you cannot use your wings to fly till they are healed by a Heal spell or a Regeneration spell.
___
With your wings, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.
___
At 18th level, your flying speed increases to 60 feet.
___

### Scales
At 18th level, your beautiful scales finally manifest. While not wearing any armour, your AC is 14 + Dexterity Modifier.
Further, you gain damage resistance to elemental damage aligned with your ancestry and from non-magical melee damage.
___

### Feral Senses
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
___
You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.
___

### The Seals Break: Exalted Hunter
Broken and destroyed, your seals are finally gone but you have not lost the experience and power you have gained, adding to your already supreme true form. But despite this, there are lingering embers that burn from your seals and you cannot maintain your true form permanently ..... yet. Maybe one day, you will find the ability to permanently remove your seal.
___
At level 20, you can finally assume your true form. You shapeshift into an ancient Dragon equivalent of your draconic species as an action. You can’t use this ability again until you finish a long rest. You can stay in your Dragon form for 1d4 + 1 hours. You cannot extend or increase your time as your true form in any way.
___
While in your true form, the following limitations apply:
* When you transform, you assume half the Dragon’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your sealed form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your sealed form. For example, if you take 10 damage in your true form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage in your sealed form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your sealed form to 0 hit points, you are not knocked unconscious.
* Your breath weapon does 15d10 damage, instead of the damage indicated on the stat block.
* If possible, your equipment drops to the floor. Worn items that are not magical (mundane armour, clothes) are destroyed during the transformation process. Any magical items on you (including worn) drops safely.
___
Your sealed form statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Dragon if they are higher (capped to 16) but you retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores, and your HP while in sealed form. You also retain all of your skills and saving throw proficiencies. In addition, you become proficient in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws if the Dragon is. If the Dragon has any legendary or lair actions, you cannot use them. You also do not gain legendary resistances.
___
Further, once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
___
