___

### Hit Points

* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per level after 1st

* **Tools:** None
* **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom
* **Skills:** Choose any two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion
___

### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (a) a Quaterstaff or (b) a Dagger
* (a) a Component Pouch, (b) an Arcane Focus
* an Explorer's Pack
* a Spellbook
___

### Spellcasting
Your own powers might have been Sealed, but you've learnt to draw from other sources. As a student of arcane magic, you have learnt to harness the Spellweave to cast arcane spells.
___

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list. You learn additional Wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the table.
___

##### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level Wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the Wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.
___

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
The table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
___
You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
___
For example, if you’re 3rd-level, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *Magic Missile*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
___
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
___

##### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
* **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
* **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
___

##### Ritual Casting
You can cast a spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.
___

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your spells.
___

##### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar from the Wizard Class).
___

### Spell Recovery
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
___
For example, if you’re at 4th-level, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
___

### The Seals Start to Fracture
At 2nd level, the tiniest cracks have begun to form in your Seals.
___
You have learned to weave your magic with power from your fundamentum to fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.
___
When you use this feature, you can’t cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.
___

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
___
Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
___

### Breath Weapon
The Seals on you start breaking. At 6th level, you can finally access your fundamentum and exhale destruction that defines a Dragon. Once per short or long rest you exhale a breath aligned with your ancestry as shown in the Dragon racial table. The damage die is d6, the number of dice is half your level (rounded down), and the save DC is your spell save DC. On a successful save, targets take half damage.
___
At 9th level, this breath can also recharge on a 20 on a d20, at 14th level, it recharges on 18 or above on a d20, and at 19th level, it recharges on 15 or above on a d20.
___

### Claws
At 10th level, the Seals deteriorate further and you are now able to manifest your claws. They are considered Finesse weapons, and deal 2d6 damage on hit. They are not considered magical weapons for the sake of overcoming immunity or resistance.
___

### Wings
The Seals deteriorate further and allow you to unfurl your wings again. At 14th level, once per long rest, you are able to manifest your wings as a bonus action. These wings last 5 hours or till you dismiss them as a bonus action. To do so, you must be wearing light armour, or no armour. If you don any other armour while your wings are present, you take 5d6 bludgeoning damage every 12 seconds. If you are reduced to 0 HP by this damage, you cannot use your wings to fly till they are healed by a Heal spell or a Regeneration spell.
___
With your wings, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.
___
At 18th level, your flying speed increases to 60 feet.
___

### Scales
At 18th level, your beautiful scales finally manifest. While not wearing any armour, your AC is 14 + Dexterity Modifier.
Further, you gain damage resistance to elemental damage aligned with your ancestry and from non-magical melee damage.
___

### The Seals Break: Archmage
Broken and destroyed, your seals are finally gone but you have not lost the experience and power you have gained, adding to your already supreme true form. But despite this, there are lingering embers that burn from your seals and you cannot maintain your true form permanently ..... yet. Maybe one day, you will find the ability to permanently remove your seal.
___
At level 20, you can finally assume your true form. You shapeshift into an ancient Dragon equivalent of your draconic species as an action. You can’t use this ability again until you finish a long rest. You can stay in your Dragon form for 1d4 + 1 hours. You cannot extend or increase your time as your true form in any way.
___
While in your true form, the following limitations apply:
* When you transform, you assume half the Dragon’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your sealed form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your sealed form. For example, if you take 10 damage in your true form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage in your sealed form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your sealed form to 0 hit points, you are not knocked unconscious.
* Your breath weapon does 15d10 damage, instead of the damage indicated on the stat block.
* If possible, your equipment drops to the floor. Worn items that are not magical (mundane armour, clothes) are destroyed during the transformation process. Any magical items on you (including worn) drops safely.
___
Your sealed form statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Dragon if they are higher (capped to 16) but you retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores, and your HP while in sealed form. You also retain all of your skills and saving throw proficiencies. In addition, you become proficient in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws if the Dragon is. If the Dragon has any legendary or lair actions, you cannot use them. You also do not gain legendary resistances.
___
Further, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
___
If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
___
